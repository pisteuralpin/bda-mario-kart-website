# Mario K'art Website
This website was created for the candidature of the Mario K'art list for the 2024 elections of the Arts office of Centrale Nantes.

It was created from scratch, with HTML CSS and JS.

The game was also made from scratch, you can find the code [here](https://github.com/pisteuralpin/mario-kart-jumper).

## Copyrights
The design was inspired by the Mario Kart game, and the characters are from the Nintendo game. I do not own any of the rights on the characters, and we do not intend to make any profit from this website. It was created for fun and for the candidature of the Mario K'art list.

Most of the images were created by us, except some of the courses icons in the "Allos" page.
Current "members" are placeholders to respect the privacy of the real members of the list, and the images are the property of Nintendo.
